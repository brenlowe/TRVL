# TRVL App Project

Multi-page mock travel website created using React.

Technologies used: React, React Router, HTML, CSS, JS, Netlify.
This project was followed alongside Brian Design to explicate the ideas behind React and how to use reusable components in a multi page site. React Router was a focal point while building this project. I ran into some issues with npm versions but managed to problem solve and debug to get the site to function.
CSS was drafted to maintain organization and easy editing if needed to be updated.
