# TRVL App Project

Multi-page mock travel website created using React.

### Router

Multiple pages set up using React Router. I had the opportunity to get my hands and practice with the React Router so I could create links within my app.

### Header and Footer

Created a reusable Header and Footer that are featured on all pages throughout the app.

### CSS

CSS was drafted in a way to maintain organization and easy editing if needed to be updated. Reusable variables came in handy.
