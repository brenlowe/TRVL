# TRVL App Project

Multi-page mock travel website created using React.

- Multiple pages set up using React Router. I had the opportunity to get my hands and practice with the React Router so I could create links within my app.
- Created a reusable Header and Footer that are featured on all pages throughout the app.
- CSS was drafted to maintain organization and easy editing if needed to be updated. Reusable variables came in handy.
